Main Components
Product Listing

Fetches product data from the backend API and displays a list of shoes with their details (e.g., name, price, image).
ProductCard component is used to display each product in a card layout.
API: GET /api/products (Spring Boot)
Add to Cart

Allows users to add products to their cart.
A button on each product card triggers the addToCart function.
The cart is stored in the local state or centralized state (e.g., Redux/Context API).
API: POST /api/cart (Spring Boot)
Wishlist

Users can save products to their wishlist for later viewing.
The Wishlist component manages adding/removing products from the wishlist.
API: POST /api/wishlist (Spring Boot)
Admin Panel

Provides functionality for the admin to manage products, categories, and users.
Includes forms for adding, updating, and deleting products.
API: POST /api/products, PUT /api/products/{id}, DELETE /api/products/{id}
State Management
Redux or Context API is used to manage the global state for the cart, wishlist, and user authentication.
Key actions: ADD_TO_CART, REMOVE_FROM_CART, ADD_TO_WISHLIST, REMOVE_FROM_WISHLIST.
Routing
React Router DOM is used for client-side routing. Key routes:

/: Home page
/products: Product listing page
/cart: Cart page
/wishlist: Wishlist page
/admin: Admin panel
Backend
Technologies
Spring Boot: Java-based framework for building REST APIs.
Spring Data JPA: For interacting with the database.
MySQL/PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing product, user, and cart data.
Spring Security: For user authentication and role-based access control (admin/user).
Architecture
The backend follows a RESTful architecture. Key components:

Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and map them to the appropriate services.
Services: Contain the business logic.
Repositories: Interact with the database using Spring Data JPA.
API Endpoints
Product APIs

GET /api/products: Fetch all products.
POST /api/products: Add a new product (Admin only).
PUT /api/products/{id}: Update product details (Admin only).
DELETE /api/products/{id}: Delete a product (Admin only).
Cart APIs

GET /api/cart/{userId}: Fetch user’s cart.
POST /api/cart: Add a product to the cart.
DELETE /api/cart/{cartItemId}: Remove a product from the cart.
Wishlist APIs
